# Advent of code 2021

These are my Python solutions to the [advent of code 2021 puzzles](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

All of the code has been developed and tested using Python version 3.9.7 without any additional external libraries.

All of the solutions are within the relevant day's folder and within that folder the Python code is saved under that day's name, e.g. Day 1 solutions are in the [day1](./day1) folder within the Python script [day1/day1.py](./day1/day1.py). All of the solutions can be ran like so:

``` bash
python day1/day1.py
```
